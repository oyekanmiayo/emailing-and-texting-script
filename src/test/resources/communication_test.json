The members of this squad who are supposed to protect us against armed robbery are killing, extorting and harassing us everyday. We are scared to move freely and we need your help. I urge you, distinguished, to use your office to protect the lives of Nigerian youth and the future of Nigeria. We are counting on you to do the right thing. We are counting on you to help us #ENDSARS. Thanks Senator!",
